# nforce :: node.js salesforce REST API wrapper

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kevinohara80/nforce.png)](http://travis-ci.org/kevinohara80/nforce)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/nforce.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/nforce)

**nforce** is node.js a REST API wrapper for force.com, database.com, and salesforce.com.

## Features

* Simple api
* Intelligent sObjects
* Helper OAuth methods
* Simple streaming
* Multi-user design with single user mode
* Plugin support

## Installation

```bash
npm install nforce
```

## Usage

Require **nforce** in your app and create a client connection to a Salesforce Remote Access Application.

```js
var nforce = require('nforce');

var org = nforce.createConnection({
  clientId: 'SOME_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID',
  clientSecret: 'SOME_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET',
  redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000/oauth/_callback',
  apiVersion: 'v27.0',  // optional, defaults to current salesforce API version
  environment: 'production',  // optional, salesforce 'sandbox' or 'production', production default
  mode: 'multi' // optional, 'single' or 'multi' user mode, multi default
});
```

Now we just need to authenticate and get our salesforce OAuth credentials. Here is one way to do this in multi-user mode...

```js
// multi user mode
var oauth;
org.authenticate({ username: 'my_test@gmail.com', password: 'mypassword'}, function(err, resp){
  // store the oauth object for this user
  if(!err) oauth = resp;
});
```

...or in single-user mode...

```js
// single-user mode
org.authenticate({ username: 'my_test@gmail.com', password: 'mypassword'}, function(err, resp){
  // the oauth object was stored in the connection object
  if(!err) console.log('Cached Token: ' + org.oauth.access_token)
});
```

Now we can go nuts. **nforce** has an salesforce sObject factory method that creates records for you. Let's use that and insert a record...

```js
var acc = nforce.createSObject('Account');
acc.set('Name', 'Spiffy Cleaners');
acc.set('Phone', '800-555-2345');
acc.set('SLA__c', 'Gold');

org.insert({ sobject: acc, oauth: oauth }, function(err, resp){
  if(!err) console.log('It worked!');
});
```

If you are in single-user mode, the `oauth` argument can be ommitted since it's cached as part of your connection object.

```js
org.insert({ sobject: acc }, function(err, resp){
  if(!err) console.log('It worked!');
});
```

Querying and updating records is super easy. **nforce** wraps API-queried records in a special object. The object caches field updates that you make to the record and allows you to pass the record directly into the update method without having to scrub out the unchanged fields. In the example below, only the Name and Industry fields will be sent in the update call despite the fact that the query returned other fields such as BillingCity and CreatedDate.

```js
var q = 'SELECT Id, Name, CreatedDate, BillingCity FROM Account WHERE Name = "Spiffy Cleaners" LIMIT 1';

org.query({ query: q }, function(err, resp){

  if(!err && resp.records) {

    var acc = resp.records[0];
    acc.set('Name', 'Really Spiffy Cleaners');
    acc.set('Industry', 'Cleaners');

    org.update({ sobject: acc, oauth: oauth }, function(err, resp){
      if(!err) console.log('It worked!');
    });

  }
});
```

## Using the Example Files

Most of the files in the examples directory can be used by simply setting two environment variables then running the files. The two environment variables are `SFUSER` and `SFPASS` which are your Salesforce.com username and passsword, respectively. Example below:

```bash
export SFUSER=myusername@salesforce.com
export SFPASS=mypassword
node examples/crud.js
```

## Authentication

**nforce** supports three Salesforce OAuth 2.0 flows, username/password, Web Server and User-Agent.

### Username/Password flow

To request an access token and other oauth information using the username and password flow, use the `authenticate()` method and pass in your username, password and security token in the options.

**Note:** A security token can be generated from the Salesforce dashboard under: Account Name > Setup > My Personal Information > Reset My Security Token.

```js
var username      = 'my_test@gmail.com',
    password      = 'mypassword',
    securityToken = 'some_security_token',
    oauth;

org.authenticate({ username: username, password: password, securityToken: securityToken }, function(err, resp){
  if(!err) {
    console.log('Access Token: ' + resp.access_token);
    oauth = resp;
  } else {
    console.log('Error: ' + err.message);
  }
});
```

The Salesforce website suggests appending the security token to the password in order to authenticate. This works, but using the `securityToken` parameter as shown above is cleaner. Here's why the security token is necessary, from the [Salesforce Website][sf]:

> The security token is an automatically generated key that must be added to the end of the password in order to log in to Salesforce from an untrusted network. You must concatenate their password and token when passing the request for authentication.

[sf]: http://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=remoteaccess_oauth_username_password_flow.htm&language=en_US

### Web Server Code Flow

To perform an authorization code flow, first redirect users to the Authorization URI at Salesforce. **nforce** provides a helper function to build this url for you.

```js
org.getAuthUri();
```

An example of using this function in a typical node route would be:

```js
app.get('/auth/sfdc', function(req,res){
  res.redirect(org.getAuthUri());
});
```

Once you get a callback at the Redirect URI that you specify, you need to request your access token and other important oauth information by calling `authenticate()` and passing in the "code" that you received.

```js
var oauth;

org.authenticate({ code: 'SOMEOAUTHAUTHORIZATIONCODE' }, function(err, resp){
  if(!err) {
    console.log('Access Token: ' + resp.access_token);
    oauth = resp;
  } else {
    console.log('Error: ' + err.message);
  }
});
```

An example of using this function in a typical node route and populating the code from the request would be:

```js
app.get('/auth/sfdc/callback', function(req, res) {
  org.authenticate({code: req.query.code}, function(err, resp){
    if(!err) {
      console.log('Access Token: ' + resp.access_token);
    } else {
      console.log('Error: ' + err.message);
    }
  });
});
```

### User-Agent Flow

The user-agent flow simply redirects to your `redirectUri` after the user authenticates and logs in. The `getAuthUri()` method can be used similar to the Web Server flow but a responseType property must be set to `token`.

```js
org.getAuthUri({ responseType: 'token' });
```

### OAuth Object

At the end of a successful authorization, you are returned an OAuth object for the user. This object contains your salesforce access token, endpoint, id, and other information.  If you have `mode` set to `multi`, cache this object for the user as it will be used for subsequent requests. If you are in `single` user mode, the OAuth object is stored as a property on your salesforce connection object.

### OAuth Object De-Coupling (Multi-user mode)

**nforce** decouples the oauth credentials from the connection object when `mode` is set to `multi` so that in a multi-user situation, a separate connection object doesn't need to be created for each user. This makes the module more efficient. Essentially, you only need one connection object for multiple users and pass the OAuth object in with the request. In this scenario, it makes the most sense to store the OAuth credentials in the users session or in some other data store. If you are using [express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express), **nforce** can take care of storing this for you (see Express Middleware).

### Integrated OAuth Object (Single-user mode)

If you specified `single` as your `mode` when creating the
connection, calling authenticate will store the OAuth object within
the connection object. Then, in subsequent API requests, you can
simply omit the OAuth object from the request like so.

```js
// look ma, no oauth argument!
org.query({ query: 'SELECT Id FROM Lead LIMIT 1' }, function(err, res) {
  if(err) return console.error(err);
  else return console.log(res.records[0]);
});
```

### Access Token Auto-Refreshes

**nforce** provides an optional, built-in function for auto-refreshing access tokens when able it's able to. This requires you are using the web-server flow and you've requested the right scope that returns you a refresh_token. The username/password flow is also supported if using single-user mode.

To enable auto-refreshes, you just need to set the `autoRefresh` argument when creating your connection...

```js
var nforce = require('nforce');

var org = nforce.createConnection({
  clientId: 'SOME_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID',
  clientSecret: 'SOME_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET',
  redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000/oauth/_callback',
  apiVersion: 'v44.0',
  environment: 'production',
  mode: 'multi',
  autoRefresh: true // <--- set this to true
});
```

Now when you make requests and your access token is expired, **nforce** will automatically refresh your access token from Salesforce and re-try your original request...

```js
console.log('old token: ' + oauth.access_token);
org.query({ query: 'SELECT Id FROM Account LIMIT 1', oauth: oauth }, function(err, records){
  if(err) throw err;
  else {
    console.log('query completed with token: ' + oauth.access_token); // <--- if refreshed, this should be different
    res.send(body);
  }
});
```

**NOTE:** If you're using express and storing your oauth in the session, if you pass in your session oauth directly, it's going to be updated automatically by nforce since the autoRefresh function mutates the oauth object that's passed in.

There's also a handy callback function called `onRefresh` that can be added to your connection that will execute when any request triggers an auto-refresh of your access token. This makes keeping stored credentials up-to-date a breeze. Here's a pseudo-example of how that would work.

```js
var nforce = require('nforce');

var org = nforce.createConnection({
  clientId: 'SOME_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID',
  clientSecret: 'SOME_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET',
  redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000/oauth/_callback',
  apiVersion: 'v44.0',
  environment: 'production',
  mode: 'multi',
  autoRefresh: true, // <--- set this to true
  onRefresh: function(newOauth, oldOauth, cb) {
    // find outdated access tokens in the db and update them
    mydb.findOauthByAccessToken(oldOauth.access_token, function(err, oauth) {
      oauth.access_token = newOauth.access_token;
      oauth.save();
      // make sure you call the callback from the onRefresh function
      cb();
    });
  }
});
```

## Other Features

### Force.com Streaming API Support

**nforce** supports the Force.com Streaming API. Connecting to one of your PushTopics is easy using nforce. Here's how you create a streaming client and subscribe to a PushTopic.

```js
org.authenticate({ username: user, password: pass }, function(err, oauth) {

  if(err) return console.log(err);

  var client = org.createStreamClient();

  console.log('subscribing to ' + logs._topic);
  var accs = client.subscribe({ topic: 'NewAccounts' });

  accs.on('error', function(err) {
    console.log('subscription error');
    console.log(err);
    client.disconnect();
  });

  accs.on('data', function(data) {
    console.log(data);
  });

});
```

There is also a short-hand method for creating a client and a subscription right from your nforce connection object. You can access the underlying client from the subscription object.

```js
var accs = org.subscribe({ topic: 'NewAccounts' });

// close the client after 5 seconds
setTimeout(function(){
  accs.client.disconnect();
}, 5000);
```

When you are done with your subscription you can close it. You can also disconnect the client connection.

```js
accs.cancel();
client.disconnect();
```

### Plugins

As of **nforce** v0.7.0, a plugin API is now exposed so that the capabilities of nforce can easily be extended. This plugin system also allows the core of nforce to remain small, handling mostly authentication, CRUD, query, search,and other basic API requests. As Salesforce releases additional API's or as authors find interesting ways to extend nforce, these can easily be built into plugins and added to your nforce configuration as-needed.

To use plugins in your application, you'll need to load them into nforce and specify which plugins to use when creating a connection object. Here is an example.

```js
var nforce = require('nforce');

// load the plugin
require('myplugin')(nforce);

var org = nforce.createConnection({
  clientId:     process.env.CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET,
  redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000/oauth/_callback',
  plugins:     ['myplugin'] // make sure you enable it when creating a connection
});

org.myplugin.getSomeData(function(err, data) {
  console.log(data);
});
```

You'll notice that the plugins methods are all namespaced. This is to prevent method naming conflicts between plugins. As a best-practice, plugin authors should make their namespace the same as the module name but it's best to refer to their documentation for the exact namespace when using their] plugin.

Here is a list of some available plugins today:

* [nforce-tooling](https://github.com/jeffdonthemic/nforce-tooling) Tooling API support
* [nforce-chatter](https://github.com/jeffdonthemic/nforce-chatter) Chatter API support
* [nforce-metadata](https://github.com/kevinohara80/nforce-metadata) Metadata API support
* [nforce-express](https://github.com/kevinohara80/nforce-express) Express.js plugin for OAuth authentication helpers

Documentation on authoring plugins is coming soon...

## nforce API Basics

### Callbacks

The API of **nforce** follows typical node.js standards. Callbacks will always pass an optional error object, and a response object. The response object closely resembles the typical responses from the Salesforce REST API.

```js
var myCallback = function(err, resp);

org.getUrl(url, myCallback);
```

### Promises

**nforce** also supports promises based on native promises. When no callback is supplied to an asynchronous method (like an api call), a promise will be returned. This makes control-flow very simple.

```js
org.authenticate({ username: un, password: pw }).then(function(){
  return org.getResources();
}).then(function(resources) {
  console.log('resources: ' + resources);
}).catch(function(err) {
  console.error('there was a problem');
});
```

## nforce Base Methods

### createConnection(opts)

The createConnection method creates an *nforce* salesforce connection object. You need to supply some arguments including oauth information and some optional arguments for version and salesforce environment type.

* `clientId`: (String:Required) This is the OAuth client id.
* `clientSecret`: (String:Required) This is the OAuth client secret.
* `redirectUri`: (String:Required) This is the redirect URI for OAuth callbacks.
* `apiVersion`: (String|Number:Required) This is a number or string representing a valid REST API version. Default is the latest current api version.
* `environment`: (String:Optional) Values can be 'production' or 'sandbox'. Default is production.
* `authEndpoint`: (String:Optional) Used to override the authentication endpoint for production environments.
* `testAuthEndpoint`: (String:Optional) Used to override the authentication endpoint for production environments.
* `loginUri`: (String:Optional) Used to override the login URI if needed.
* `testLoginUri`: (String:Optional) Used to override the testLoginUri if needed.
* `gzip`: (Boolean:Optional) If set to boolean 'true', then *nforce* will request that salesforce compress responses (using gzip) before transmitting over-the-wire.
* `autoRefresh`: (Boolean:Optional) If set to boolean 'true', *nforce* will auto-refresh your oauth access token if it tries a request and fails due to an expired token. Only works with web oauth and username/password flows.
* `onRefresh`: (Function:Optional) This is a function that is called when a request going through the connection triggers an auto-refresh. This hook is handy for updating your oauth tokens in a database or other store. The function is passed three arguments `newOauth`, `oldOauth`, and a `callback` function. The callback must be called with either an error or null value.
* `timeout`: (Number:Optional) Integer containing the number of milliseconds to wait for a request to respond before aborting the request.
* `username`: (String:Optional) The username to be used for the connection (single-user mode only).
* `password`: (String:Optional) The password to be used for the connection (single-user mode only).
* `securityToken`: (String:Optional) The security token to be used for the connection (single-user mode only).
* `oauth`: (Object:Optional) The oauth object to be used for the connection (single-user mode only).

### createSObject(type, [fieldValues])

This creates an sObject record that you can use to insert, update, upsert, and delete. `type` should be the salesforce API name of the sObject that you are updating. `fieldValues` should be a hash of field names and values that you want to initialize your sObject with. You can also just assign fields and values by setting properties after you create the sObject.

## plugin(namespace|opts)

This creates an nforce plugin. Plugins allow you to extend the functionality of nforce. You need to initialize the plugin with a `namespace` or an options hash containing a namespace. Valid options include:

* `namespace`: (String:Required) This sets the namespace for your plugin.
* `override`: (Boolean:Optional) Override *true* allows you to overwrite an existing plugin. Default is false.

## Salesforce sObject Methods

### toJSON()

Returns a JSON representation of the fields in the sObject.

## Connection Methods

The following list of methods are available for an **nforce** connection object.

Please note that you may pass custom `headers` to any of the requests that support an `opts` hash. Here is an example:

```js
var headers = {
  'sforce-auto-assign': '1'
};

org.insert({ oauth: oauth, sobject: so, headers: headers }, function(err, record) {
  // callback
});
```
